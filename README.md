## What is CyberTuz?

CyberTuz is a free, open-source, terminal-based cyber security learning platform built entirely in Bash and designed to run on [Termux](https://termux.dev) on Android. It covers ethical hacking, penetration testing, network security, web application security, cryptography, digital forensics, CTF challenges, and real-world pentest simulations — all from your phone.

> **For educational purposes only.** All content is designed to teach legal and ethical security practices.

---

## Features

- **17 learning modules** covering beginner to expert topics
- **13 language support** — English, Indonesian, Hindi, Malay, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Arabic, Spanish, Italian, Korean
- **Training Arena** — leveled hands-on practice (Newbie → Expert)
- **Mission System** — real-world pentest simulation tasks
- **CTF challenges** — capture the flag practice exercises
- **Live practice** — real commands against safe targets (scanme.nmap.org, etc.)
- **Progress tracking** — scores and mission completion saved locally
- **No internet required** for most features
- **Completely free** — no ads, no tracking, no subscriptions
